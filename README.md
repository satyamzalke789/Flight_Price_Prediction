**Airline Price Predictor ✈️**

This project is a machine learning–based web application that predicts airline ticket prices using a Random Forest model. Built with Python, Streamlit, and scikit-learn, it provides an intuitive interface where users can input flight details and instantly receive a price prediction.

**Key Features**

1-Interactive Web App: Developed using Streamlit with a modern airline-themed UI for an engaging user experience.
2-Flight Details Input: Users can specify airline, source and destination cities, departure and arrival times, number of stops, travel class, flight duration, and days left until departure.
3-Machine Learning Model: A trained Random Forest Regressor processes these inputs to predict realistic flight prices.
4-Custom Styling: Includes a responsive design with gradient themes, icons, and branded banners to simulate a professional airline platform.
5-Instant Predictions: Outputs the estimated ticket price in a clean, highlighted format for easy readability.

**Workflow**

1-Data Preparation: Flight data was preprocessed from a CSV dataset, including categorical encoding, feature engineering, and handling of numerical variables.
2-Model Training: Multiple algorithms were tested, and Random Forest was selected for its accuracy and robustness in regression tasks.
3-Deployment: The trained model is stored as a .pkl file and integrated into the Streamlit app for real-time predictions.

**Tech Stack**
Python (pandas, scikit-learn, joblib)
Streamlit for web app development
Random Forest Regressor for prediction modeling
Custom CSS Styling for an airline-inspired theme

**Use Cases**

Helps travelers estimate ticket prices before booking.
Can be extended for dynamic pricing strategies in airline management.
Useful for educational purposes in machine learning and web app deployment.
