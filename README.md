# Flight_Price_Prediction
This project is a machine learning-powered web app that predicts airline ticket prices based on multiple flight-related features. Built with Python, Random Forest Regression, and Streamlit, it provides an interactive and visually appealing interface where users can input flight details and instantly get an estimated ticket price.

Interactive Web App: Developed using Streamlit with a modern airline-themed UI for an engaging user experience.

Flight Details Input: Users can specify airline, source and destination cities, departure and arrival times, number of stops, travel class, flight duration, and days left until departure.

Machine Learning Model: A trained Random Forest Regressor processes these inputs to predict realistic flight prices.

Custom Styling: Includes a responsive design with gradient themes, icons, and branded banners to simulate a professional airline platform.

Instant Predictions: Outputs the estimated ticket price in a clean, highlighted format for easy readability.
